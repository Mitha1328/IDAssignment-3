## Design Process
There are 3 scenes in the game.
1. The user follows the main character and guesses if the statement made is a fact or a myth.
2. The user follows the main character who is sick and helps her make a choice.
3. The user follows the main character to help him make good choices so that both the user and the main character can learn good habits that helps in this Covid situation.

### Technologies Used
We both as a team have used **Jquery, Javascript, API and styling properties** to bring out the creativity and attraction to the page. 
* #### JQuery & Javascript
* Jquery and Javascript allows a choice based game for the user so that each of their choices gives a personalised output.
* #### API
* API is used as a quick and easy way for the user to tell what is happening in the world because of this Covid-19 virus outbreak
*  #### CSS
* We used minimal CSS styling properties as we wanted the website to have an uniformed theme and style

### Interesting Bugs
Tested on Chrome: Works well.
Tested on Firefox: Works well. Same as chrome.
Tested on Oppo Reno 2: Works well. Aligned well.
Tested on iPhone 7+: Works well. Aligned not so well.

#### Our Debugging experience
Main bug problem we faced was with scene 3 and 2. As the user made choices we had to go back to each of the javascript files to hide certain properties and show them when needed.
We also went into some linking issues. The linking of the js files with the main code file.
